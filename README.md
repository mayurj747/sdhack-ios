When is Angela's Birthday? What time is Angela's Birthday? What time is the birthday party for Angela? These are essentially the same question, and answering the same question over and over again is, quite frankly, frustrating. So what if we made an app that compares an incoming question with questions you have answered before and suggests an answer for you? Well, that's just what Manny is.

When a question comes into the chat, the app will first evaluate the intent of the question. What information is the user asking for? After establishing intent, it will search through previously answered questions and either suggest an answer based on previous answers from the user or prompt the user for a new answer and stores that data. Manny will remember answers for you, so you don't have to type them all over again.
